Eagle Touch TODO
================
BUGS
- Album Art on search results screen always shows first hit (temporarily disabled) / Search screen thumbnails mustn't be identical to initial thumbnail
- allow_edit_queue in skin options dialog doesn't work as expected
- An empty square appears around the queue area in the player of the acer atom testbed
- If player is paused and a track is being added the queue is being deleted (bug comes from original Eagle Blue Touch already)

Joachim's ToDo list
===================
- Only prompt for confirmation if an album is being queued if corresponding config option is checked
- Highlight letter of the cover page the user is on
- Add color pickers or color selection for fonts
- Use tasklist to figure out wether a task is running and only kill it if applicable
- Convert targeted boxes to display the time into functions to eliminate black phantom boxes (bug!)
- Convert DrawCover function to actually work as expected as far as search and queue display are concerned
- Display thumbnails in search results (pre-requisite: DrawCover works as expected)
- Display thumbnails on queue screen (pre-requisite: DrawCover works as expected)
- Add page titles to all pages except cover screen
- Convert current queue message into a message on the screen that goes away after some time has elapsed
